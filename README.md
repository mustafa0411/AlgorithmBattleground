# Algorithm Battleground

Efficiency Tester for Algorithms and Data Structures

## The Rundown

Welcome to the Algorithm Battleground project! This program is crafted to evaluate the efficiency of various algorithms and data structures using a substantial dataset from NASA's PALFA survey. The dataset contains about 10,000 signals/elements, some of which are corrupted and the program incorporates multiple levels of error checking to accurately assess the data and test different algorithms on diverse datasets.
